# Todo.js
###  Quickly save notes and tasks in volatile memory!

This is a todo/notes app that "saves" tasks and notes in RAM. 
I'm using refresh some of my JS knowledge, and to have something to build upon.

### Setup
To fetch the dependencies of the project, install [Bower](http://bower.io/) and run:
```
bower install
```
Everything should then work automagically.
